## Introduction

> The Christmas monster got access to some files and made a lot of weird changes. Can you help fix these changes?  
> Use a (python) script to do the following:

>	extract all the files in the archives  
>	extract metadata from the files  
>	extract text from the files

> Use the questions to guide you on how to write the script. [Check out the supporting material here](./Supporting_Doc.pdf).

> 1) How many files did you extract(excluding all the .zip files)

td:lr Answer: **50**

> 2) How many files contain Version: 1.1 in their metadata?

===============================================================================

Download the [zip file](./final-final-compressed.zip).

Using the examples and guide from the supporting doc, we need to write a python script to extract recursively for all files.

[Python Script](./recursive-unzip.py) here.
